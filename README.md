# Introducing Git-Discord üöÄ

Git-Discord is your ultimate bridge between GitHub and Discord. Seamlessly connect your development workflow and chat communication like never before.

[This is the GitHub account for Git-Discord](https://github.com/Git-Discord)

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features:

- **Issue and PR Management:** Close, label, and manage issues and pull requests directly from Discord with a simple command.

- **Real-time Updates:** Stay in the loop with real-time notifications of new GitHub issues and pull requests posted in your Discord channels.

- **Interactive Discussions:** Comment on GitHub issues and pull requests right from Discord, fostering collaborative development discussions.

- **Identity Integration:** Authenticate with GitHub through the bot to ensure your comments are posted with your identity.

## üîê Authentication: Supercharge Your Experience!

One of the most exciting aspects of Git-Discord is the authentication feature. To get started, follow these simple steps:

1. Direct Message the Bot: Send a direct message to the Git-Discord bot with the command `!auth`.

2. Receive a Message: You will receive a message with a URL. Click on the provided URL.

3. GitHub Login: Log in with your GitHub account when prompted.

4. Let the Bot Handle the Rest: Once you've authenticated, the bot will take care of the rest, allowing you to run actions as yourself.

With authentication, you can:

- Run actions and commands as yourself, not just the bot.
- Comment on issues and pull requests with your GitHub identity.
- Gain access to additional commands such as `!tup`, `!tdown`, `!label`, and `!close` that are available to authenticated users.

This authentication process not only enhances your interaction with Git-Discord but also ensures that your contributions and actions on GitHub are attributed to you directly.

## ‚ú® New Feature: "!review" Command

We are excited to introduce a new feature to Git-Discord! You can now use the `!review` command in your Discord threads to streamline your GitHub code review process. 
- Please Note: The bot uses gpt3.5-turbo for the review responses to keep costs low.

Here are a few ways you can use the `!review` command:

- `!review`: Use this command in a Discord thread to initiate a code review.
- `!review #1234`: Reference a specific pull request by its number.
- `!review github_pr_url`: Provide the GitHub pull request URL to start a review.
